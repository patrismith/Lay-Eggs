**Lay Eggs** was created for the [Mini Ludum Dare 49 competition] [3]. Code and art was created by P. Smith (as pancakecity) and the background song was created by S. Duda. Code is under the MIT license, and game assets are copyrighted to their respective creators. We made extensive use of [Coquette] [4], a Javascript micro-framework.
