      <ul>
      <li>Space bar: lay an egg or perform a mating call</li>

      <p>This is a simulation of the Circle species. You will control various Circles; the one you currently control will be surrounded with a halo.</p>
      <p>There are female and male circles. The females are quicker and smaller, and the males are larger and slower.</p>
      <p>The female can lay a limited number of eggs in her lifetime. Once she lays them all, she gets no more.
        The female must become fertilized first, by passing through a male performing the mating call.</p>
      <p>The male can perform the mating call but once in his lifetime. It looks like the outline of a circle radiating from its center.</p>
      <p>Squares begin to invade from offscreen. If a circle touches one, they both are destroyed.
        Without your help, the squares will eventually destroy all the circles.</p>
      <p>By strategizing, can you get the population to 100?</p>
