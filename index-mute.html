      <div class="controls"><p>Controls:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><em>Space bar</em> or <em>Click bottom right corner</em>: lay an egg or perform a mating call</li>
      <li><em>Click the canvas</em>: direct your circle to move to that location</li>
      <li><em>Click and drag on the canvas</em>: direct your circle to follow the cursor</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is a simulation of the Circle species. You will start the game controlling one of these creatures. Your goal is to <em>increase the population to 100 individuals.</em></p>
      <h3>Player Circle</h3>
      <p>The Circle you currently control is surrounded by a <em>yellow halo</em>. Move your Circle around the screen by <em>clicking</em> on the spot where you'd like it to go. You can also <em>click-and-drag</em> to have your Circle follow your mouse cursor.</p>
      <p>If your Circle dies, <em>control will switch to another Circle</em>. Look for the yellow halo to identify it.</p>
      <h3>Circle Biology</h3>
      <p>Circles have a limited lifespan. If they survive all other hazards, they will eventually die of old age.</p>
      <p>When Circles are born, they are very pale. Circles can reproduce once their color has darkened. There are <em>female</em> and <em>male</em> Circles. You can identify them by their size and behavior. The females are quicker and smaller. The males are larger and slower.</p>
      <p>The female Circle can <em>lay eggs</em> that hatch into baby Circles. In order to lay them, she must first be <em>fertilized</em> by a male Circle while he performs the <em>mating call</em>. This is accomplished by <em>colliding</em> or passing through the male Circle's body.</p>
      <p>The male can perform the <em>mating call</em> but once in his lifetime. It looks like an outline radiating from its center. Any female Circle of sufficient age who passes within him will become <em>fertile</em>, and able to lay her eggs.</p>
      <p>If you are playing as a female Circle, <em>press the space bar</em> or <em>tap the bottom right corner</em> to lay an egg. If you are playing as a male Circle, press the space bar to perform the mating call. Warning! An individual Circle only gets <em>one mating call</em> or <em>five eggs</em> for the duration of their existence.</p>
      <h3>Enemies of the Circle</h3>
      <p><em>Squares</em> will begin to invade from offscreen. If a circle touches one, they both are <em>destroyed</em>.</p>
      <p>Without your help, the squares will eventually destroy all the circles. By strategizing, can you get the population to 100?</p>
